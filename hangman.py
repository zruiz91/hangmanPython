#Step 1
import random


word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#Todo-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.

chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)
#Todo-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

#Todo-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.
